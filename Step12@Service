        * Society
    
    FOR each service activity in Non_AA_service:
        - Log details (number of people, means of communication, time spent, lessons learned)

Step 5: Reflect on non-AA service activities
    - Review Non_AA_service with Higher Power
    - Ask:
        * What more could I do?
        * What could I do better?
        * What could I do differently?
        * What could I do instead?
